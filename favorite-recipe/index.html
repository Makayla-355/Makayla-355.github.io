                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups old fashioned rolled oats</li>
                    <li>2 cups flour (spooned and leveled)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups freeze dried strawberries</li>
                    <li>1 cup unsalted butter (melted and cooled for ~10 minutes (I just melt the butter in a large
                        microwave safe bowl))</li>
                    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup brown sugar (light or dark, packed)</li>
                    <li>1 large egg (room temperature)</li>
                    <li>1 large egg yolk (room temperature)</li>
                    <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a couple baking sheets with parchment paper, set aside.</li>
                    <li>Pulse the oats in a food processor about 10 times. They should have some texture to them, not finely ground. Place the oats in a mixing bowl. Set aside for now.</li>
                    <li>Add the freeze dried strawberries to the food processor, and blitz until it becomes a fine powder. A few little strawberry pieces are okay, but it should mostly be a fine powder. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>To the oats, whisk in 3 Tbsp. of the strawberry powder, the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add both sugars to the cooled butter and whisk until smooth. Be sure to break up any brown sugar clumps.</li>
                    <li>Whisk in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract.</li>
                    <li>Add the dry ingredients into the wet and stir just until combined.</li>
                    <li>Scoop cookies with a 2 Tbsp. cookie scoop (I actually make mine just a liiiittle smaller than 2 full Tbsp), roll into balls and place on prepared baking sheets. I like to bake 6 cookies at a time. If you make them smaller you can bake about 8 at a time. Keep the cookie dough in the fridge between batches.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 9-11 minutes, do not over bake or they will be dry/crunchy instead of soft and chewy. Right when you take them out of the oven, place a circular cookie cutter or something circular that’s larger than the cookie so you don’t cut off any edges, and give the cookies a spin to give them a perfect circular shap</li>
                    <li>Allow to rest on the cookie sheet for just a couple minutes, then transfer to a wire rack lined with parchment paper to cool.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>

	<h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measurment</h1>
    <p>Absolute CSS length units have a set size and do not change based on screen size or other elements whereas relative length units adjust based on something else, such as the parent element. The difference is that absolute units stay the same, while relative units are flexible.Pt is one point. Px is one pixel on a computer screen its a dot. 
Vh is a unit that represents a percentage of the window height. Vw is like vh expect it represents a percentage of the width of the window height.
Cap is equal to the height of capital letters in a font. Ex is the x height of a font which typically defaults to height of a lowercase letter. Ch is the width of a font. </p>
